# Introduction
Live.ly is a project that I have built within a 24-hour hackathon - Hack The Burgh VII on 6-7 March 2021 (it is my first hackathon) with my friend, Mohmed Ishak (https://github.com/ishakmohmed). This project aims to act as an interactive browser homepage that isn't only pleasant to see but offers some features just good enough to kick-start your day in front of the computer.

[4] Live.ly is a "lively" or "lit" dashboard for you to look at instead of the boring browser homepage that you see every day. It presents you the latest hot news (thanks to NY Times API) in the section to your right, has a to-do app integrated in the left section, and in the mid-section, it greets you and presents random advice (thanks to Advice Slip API) of the day. 

[5] Technologies/Features Used:
* React.js
* NY Times API (API to get the latest news)
* Advice Slip API (API to generate random advice)
* React Hooks
* React Icons
* Material-UI
* Bootstrap
* Axios (library to make HTTP requests)
* CSS

[6] How to Run the Project: If you want to see the live, deployed version, head over to this link: https://livelyy.netlify.app/ If you want to run the source code locally on your machine, start by downloading the source code. Make sure Node.js is installed globally on your machine. In the root of the folder (in terminal), type "npm i" to install all dependencies. Then, type "npm start" and you'll see the Live.ly app launched on your favorite web browser.
